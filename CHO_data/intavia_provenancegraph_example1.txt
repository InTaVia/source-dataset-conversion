One named graph for:
- one source data set which has been processed with one method (prov:Activity or subclass p-plan Activity)
- the named graphy metadata therefore has to document
    - metadata on the source (e.g. the source database/ source biography lexicon)
    - metadata on data processing (e.g. NLP)
- CHALLENGE:
    - there are various layers on "sources", how can we structure them in a comprehensible way? -> experiment with PROV-O/ P-Plan/ look at bgn/ edm:provider/ edm:dataProvider ...
